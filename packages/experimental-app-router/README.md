> [!CAUTION]
> This package has been **deprecated** due to lack of Apollo support for React Server Components and Next's App Router. The team is working on [tooling to replace Faust](https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit) and this will include App Router support. You may continue to use this package though it will not receive any further bug fixes or security patches. If you need bug fixes or security updates we'd recommend copying the source code of this package directly into your project for use or use a tool such as [`patch-package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package).

An archive of this plugin and various resources is available on the [`archive-experimental-app-router`](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/archive-experimental-app-router/packages/experimental-app-router) branch.
